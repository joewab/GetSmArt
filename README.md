Hello! Thanks for checking out my project. I'm not quite done with the README file so please forgive its sparseness.

This is a full-stack desktop application called GetSmart. It is designed to allow users to create and share galleries of images of artworks, and then play a game using those images where they get points for guessing the artist, title, year, and media.

I used HTML, CSS, Material-UI, JavaScript, React, Redux, Saga, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Passport to create it. Enjoy!
